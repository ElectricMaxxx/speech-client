# Speech Client

This is my very first try on a voice controlled system for my working machine.

For that i need a speech interpretation to get words as strings to convert them into commands

Vision:

* [x] Convert Speech into Word by google speech api (should work with GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS exported)
* [ ] Got an service which converts the words into valid commands to handle on the mashin
* * [ ] First start with opening and controlling browser and browser apps with electron
* * [ ] Got my IDE working voice controlled
* * [ ] Got my console working voice controlled
* [ ] Build a start up script to serve my OS
* [ ] Opensource it and think about decoupling from OSs
* [ ] Let AI handle words -> command conversion

### Should be installed (currently on my Ubuntu host machine):

* libsox-fmt-all
* sox
* ffmpeg
